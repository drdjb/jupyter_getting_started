    "- The other way is by using 'pip', which is the package installer for Python, and so to use this, you must already have Python installed. <br>Once Python is installed, the following commands must be used in the Command Prompt (Windows), or the Terminal (MacOS/Linux):<br> <code>pip install --upgrade pip</code> <br> <code>pip install jupyter</code>\n",
